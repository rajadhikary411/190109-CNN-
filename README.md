# Vehicles & Animals Image Classification with CIFAR-10

This project implements a complete CNN image classification pipeline using PyTorch, trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluated on both the standard test set and real-world smartphone images.
The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluated on real-world smartphone images to analyze generalization performance.

## Dataset
- **Standard Dataset:** CIFAR-10 (10 classes)
- **Classes Used:**  
  airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck

- **Custom Dataset:**  
  Real-world smartphone images captured by the author(some from internet) and stored in `data/custom`.

**Training Plots**

The following plots were generated automatically during training:

Training Loss vs Epochs

Shows smooth and stable convergence


Training Accuracy vs Epochs

Accuracy increases from ~73% to over 91%

These plots demonstrate effective learning behavior and stable optimization.
## Evaluation & Results
Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix was generated on the CIFAR-10 test dataset to analyze per-class performance.

**Key Observations**

Strong performance on structured object classes (automobile, truck, ship)

Some confusion among visually similar animal classes (cat, dog, deer, bird)

This behavior is expected due to CIFAR-10’s low resolution (32×32)

**Visual Error Analysis**

Three misclassified samples from the CIFAR-10 test set were visualized, showing:

Real-World Smartphone Image Predictions

The trained model was evaluated on custom smartphone images stored in data/custom.

For each image, the system automatically outputs:

**Observations**

Vehicles (automobile, truck, ship) are classified with high confidence

Animal classes occasionally show confusion (e.g., bird vs cat)

Confidence scores vary due to domain shift between CIFAR-10 and real-world images

This analysis highlights common failure cases and demonstrates the model’s limitations on fine-grained object details.

---
**Key Takeaways**

The CNN successfully learns CIFAR-10 visual patterns

Training behavior is stable and well-converged

Real-world testing highlights domain differences and generalization limits

The project demonstrates an end-to-end deep learning workflow using PyTorch
